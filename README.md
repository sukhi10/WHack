Hacking Terminal Simulator

A simple, interactive "hacking terminal" simulator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project mimics the look and feel of a terminal interface, where random "hacking commands" appear as users press any key. The aesthetic is inspired by classic sci-fi movies with a black background and green neon text.
